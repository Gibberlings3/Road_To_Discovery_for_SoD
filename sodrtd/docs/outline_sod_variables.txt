We identified several instances of information the PC gets to learn during the SoD campaign which are important to understand Caelar's real motivations behind the crusade - as well as Hephernaan's.
In addition, there is also variables that keep track of what coalition forces know and whether they heard from the PC or by other sources. This is especially helpful in case your mod wants to reference the knowledge and how the coalition came to it.

Road to Discovery patches variables with the postfix "_SET" to all instances where the PC or the coalition will learn about certain game events.

The overall detection variables listed here will be set once after the "xxx_SET" variable is set via script that is called for "Global("C#RtD_VariableEvaluation","GLOBAL",1)".

Important note: Do *not* set or increment the global trigger variables listed here in your mod (i.e. the ones without the _SET postfix), as it could screw up the overall variable and journal system.

Read the readme, section "VARIABLE SYSTEM: GENERAL DESCRIPTION FOR MODDERS" for more info about how to use the tracking system and feel free to get in contact with me if questions arise.

The variables including "Coal" are for the Dukes and coalition officers' knowledge.

Note: "C#" is my personal prefix. The tracking variables should be used as they are named inside Road to Discovery. But for own mod projects, use your own perfix. If you do not have an own personal prefix yet, register one at https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/1649-community-filename-prefix-reservations/.
